HOOOOOOOOOOMEEEEEE RUNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!! (50 points)
-----------------------

**Challenge**

AND JAKE IS ROUNDING THE BASES \
HE PASSES BASE 32!!! \
HE ROUNDS BASE 64!!!!!!! \
WE'RE WITNESSING A MIRACLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just one more base to go ;D

**Hint**

```
Ecbf1HZ_kd8jR5K?[";(7;aJp?[4>J?Slk3<+n'pF]W^,F>._lB/=r
```

**Solution**

The flag is [Base85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85) (also named Ascii85) encoded. 
Decode either with Python (see home_run.py - using the base64 python package) or use an online tool like [cryptii](https://cryptii.com/).

Don't Give The GIANt a COOKie (100 points)
-----------------------

**Challenge**

It was just a typical day in the bakery for Delphine. She was preparing her famous chocolate cake, when all of a sudden a GIANt burst through the doors of her establishment and demanded a cookie. Being the strong-willed girl she was, Delphine refused and promptly threw her rolling pin at the GIANt. Doing what any sensible being would do when faced with projectiles, the GIANt let out a shriek and ran out of the shop. Delphine smiled to herself, it was another day well done.

But oh? What's this? It seems the GIANt dropped this behind while he was screaming and scrambling out of the shop.

**Hint**

This challenge still follows typical flag format, just wrap your answer with rtcp{answer_here}.

Non-case sensitive.

**Solution**

The secret consists of 32 hexadecimal digits which indicates a 128-bit (16-byte) [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hash. Alot of MD5 hashes (including this one) can be decrypted with [online decoders](https://www.md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html).

**Solution**

The challenge text seems to have the spaces in the right place but the characters seem translated. This text is written with a substitution cipher. With this kind of cipher more text than the flag alone is needed to decrypt it. [Guballa](https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver) can be used to decode this substitution cipher and supports mulitple languages. It gives the decrypted text and the used encryption key:

```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz     This clear text ...
sdviwenkcxpqzlamrtyohgfjbu     ... maps to this cipher text
```

[Quipquip](https://quipqiup.com/) is another tool to solve these substitution ciphers and has an input field for clues such as `tovm=rtcp`. This solver had more difficulties with uppercase characters, luckily the flag submissions for this ctf are case insensitive.

**Solution**

The characters of the flag are scrambled in their order but with the right characters. Using [Railfence]('http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/railfence.php') the flag can be decrypted with 6 rails and an offset of 9. 

Flag: `rtcp{im_1n_lov3_wi7h_y0ur_mom}`

Their are different ciphers which scamble characters with similar looking results. Trying the different tools mentioned in [John Hammonds ctf-katana](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/railfence.php) would be a great start for these kind of encryptions.

Wrong Way (150 points)
---------------------------

**Challenge**

Did you know that you've been going the wrong way entire time?

`E7Rq<G:KÇ’`

**Hint**

Format in rtcp{} format, adding _ underscores as needed. The flag should be case insensitive

**Solution**

To get the flag encode (instead of decode) the message with base64 either with the python package base64 or an online tool.

Flag: rtcp{unexpected_places}

That's Some Interesting Tea(rs)....... (175 points)
---------------------------

**Challenge**

You know, the tears of one's enemies works lovely in tea. Turns out, there's tons of different bases for tea. In fact, I think I heard Delphine talk about this chef website she used for her tea base combinations. . .

Oh! Speaking of which, GIANt wants Delphine to make him tea. . . all he has is the tea leaves and the cup though. Maybe you can help Delphine, since she's really busy with cooking other things?

**Solution**

Secret has all capital characters, doesn't use all the numbers and has a equal sign at the end for padding. This suggest a base32 encoded message. Since this challenge will require multiple decodings it might be more convenient to use [CyberChef](http://icyberchef.com/) rather than python.
